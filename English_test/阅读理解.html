                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Remember global warming? Back in December, the threat of climate change was thundering and the rich countries agreed to cut their carbon-dioxide and other green-house-related emissions. Since then, interest has cooled markedly, and many European countries are already running away from the promises they made so loudly a few months ago. But there has been much talk, and a bit of action, to encourage renewable energies such as wind, hydro, solar and all living organisms. These emit no greenhouse gases, but tend to cost more than coal, oil or gas.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">The better, simpler idea is to remember that the easiest way to reduce something is to tax it <span>–</span> in this case, by taxing the carbon content power. The dirtier the power, the more tax it would pay. So dirty coal would be more expensive than clean coal, which would see its price rise in relation to oil, which would be more expensive compared with gas, which would lose some of its price advantage over renewables.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Unless a carbon tax was so huge as to be economically<span> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">crippling,</span><span> it would not remove the price differential between all renewables and fossil fuels. But it would narrow that gap, by fixing the differing environmental costs into the price </span><span>–</span> a useful principle in itself. It would also give renewable producers a strong incentive to cut costs, and fossil-fuel suppliers the motivation to clean their products.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Precedents suggest strongly that a carbon tax would be effective. But the disadvantage to carbon tax is political. After almost a decade of trying, the European Union gave up an attempt at a European carbon tax last year. Germany<span>’</span><span>s ruling coalition is fighting against a proposed energy tax. In America, politicians believe that even mentioning the notion is certain death. But many of the political objections could be met if a carbon tax were made up for the loss elsewhere, for example by lowering payroll or sales taxes. There is always suspicion when governments come up with clever new ways to tax, and rightly so. The response to that suspicion should be to win the argument, not to abandon it.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: right; font-family: Times New Roman;"></p>

It is not the tools a scientist uses but how he uses these tools that makes him a scientist. You will probably agree that knowing how to use a power is important to a carpenter. You will probably agree, too, that knowing how to investigate, how to discover information, is important to everyone. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The scientist, however, goes one step further</span>, he must be sure that he has a reasonable answer to his questions and that his answer can be confirmed by other persons. He also works to fit the answers he gets to many questions into a large set of ideas about how the world works.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">The scientist<span>’</span>s knowledge must be exact. There is no room for half right or right just half the time. He must be as nearly right as the conditions permit. What works under one set of conditions at one time must work under the same conditions at other times. If the conditions are different, any changes the scientist observes in a demonstration must be explained by the changes in the conditions. This is one reason that investigations are important in science. Albert Einstein, who developed the Theory of Relativity, arrived at this theory through mathematics. The accuracy of his mathematics was later tested through investigations, <span>and </span>Einstein<span>’</span><span>s ideas were shown to be correct. A scientist uses many tools for measurements. Then the measurements are used to make mathematical calculations that may test his investigations. </span></p><p></p>

                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>There</span><span>’</span><span>s a great story about an old Finnish woman who, without quite realizing it, was using her cell-phone to access the Internet and track her city</span><span>’</span><span>s public transit system. When asked why she used the wireless Internet so frequently, she replied, </span><span>“</span><span>What are you talking about? I don</span><span>’</span><span>t know anything about this wireless Internet stuff</span><span>.</span><span> </span>I just know the bus is here.<span>”</span><span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Regardless of whether you want to admit it, a lot of us are like that old Finnish woman. When it comes to new mobile applications, many of us do not realize the capability and power that we hold, literally, in our hands.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">What we are looking at today is the mobile Internet in its infancy. Now that using the Internet from home or work has<span> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">saturated</span><span> much of society, the next logical step is to be able to use the Net when you are far away from your desktop or laptop. Speech recognition is one way to do this, and there are a number of services, collectively called the </span><span>“</span><span>voice Web</span><span>”</span><span>, that will make this possible. All you do is to use a phone or wireless device to call a phone number, and speak commands to an intuitive system. It will then give you the information you</span><span>’</span>re seeking, using either a synthesized voice or an audio file.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">In the United States and Europe, the hot technology for wireless devices is called WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), which is being considered as the world standard. WAP is supported by major phone companies including Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson, and is simply a means of transmitting information, much like HTML which is a means of communicating on the Internet.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Currently, wireless Internet connections may give you news, sports scores, stock quotes, and the weather if you<span>’</span><span>re lucky. But if you</span><span>’</span><span>ve ever used this technology, you know it</span><span>’</span><span>s slow, costly and doesn</span><span>’</span><span>t seem worth the time and effort, if it works at all. All of this technology points to easier living. Perhaps you</span><span>’</span><span>ll need to find a restaurant for an occasional business meeting. You</span><span>’</span><span>ll press a button on your mobile phone, and access the Internet to pull up a list of great restaurants in your immediate area. You</span><span>’</span><span>ll hit another button, say a few words into the handset and you</span><span>’</span><span>ve got a reservation for four. </span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: right; font-family: Times New Roman;">                                                                                                                                </p><p></p>

                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">In the United States, it is not customary to telephone someone very early in the morning. If you telephone him early in the day, while he is shaving or having breakfast, the time of the call shows that the matter is very important and requires immediate attention. The same meaning is attached to telephone calls made after 11:00 pm. If someone receives a call during sleeping hours, he assumes it's a matter of life or death. The time chosen for the call communicates its importance.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">In social life, time plays a very important part. In the U.S.A. guests tend to feel they are not highly regarded if the invitation to a dinner party is extended only three or four days before the party date. But it is not true in all countries. In other areas of the world, it may be considered foolish to make an appointment too far in advance because plans which are made for a date more than a week away tend to be forgotten. The meaning of time differs in different parts of the world. Thus, misunderstandings arise between people from different cultures that treat time differently. Promptness is valued highly in American life, for example. If people are not prompt, they may be regarded as impolite or not fully responsible. In the U.S. no one would think of keeping a business associate waiting for an hour, it would be too impolite. A person, who is 5 minutes late, will say a few words of explanation, though perhaps he will not complete the sentence. </p><p></p>

                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">It was 1985, and Rafe Esquith was beginning his third year of teaching in Los Angeles public schools. He faced a class of 40 sixth-graders from low-income homes where English rarely was spoken, and the best reader among them was two years below grade level.<span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>But to everyone</span><span>’</span>s surprise, he decided to teach them Shakespeare.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Five families agreed to let their children play <span>“</span><span>Macbeth</span><span>”</span> for two hours after school. This proved to be so much fun that, within weeks, Esquith had 28 kids happily soaking up the drama of blood and betrayal in medieval Scotland. They were learning many words they had never heard before.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">But when Esquith asked a school district supervisor for official approval, he received this note: <span>“</span><span>Mr. Esquith, it is not appropriate that you stay after school to teach Shakespeare. It would be better if you did something with the children that is academic.</span>”<span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>It would not be the last time that the narrow thinking of big-city school administration got in Esquith</span><span>’</span>s way. Yet the bearded, 6-foot-tall cyclone has proved that a teacher who thinks very big -- much harder lessons, larger projects, extra class time -- can help disadvantaged children in ways most educators never imagine.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">This was difficult at first, until he stumbled upon a concept of teaching that is at the core of his success. American children, even those from hardworking immigrant cultures, have in Esquith<span>’</span><span>s view been wrongly taught that learning should always be fun, by teachers who think hard lessons are bad for kids from low-income homes. When faced with something difficult, such students don</span><span>’</span>t know what to do.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Declaration of Independence says Americans are entitled to the pursuit of happiness, but the emphasis in public schooling has been on the happiness, he believes. <span>“</span><span>What happened to pursuit?</span><span>”</span><span> Esquith said. So he has created an entirely new universe in his classroom, cherishing effort and the slogan, </span><span>“</span><span>There Are No Shortcuts</span><span>”</span>.<span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>As for their own dramatic performances, Esquith got around the original ban on his after-school </span><span>“</span><span>Macbeth</span>”<span> </span><span>rehearsals by switching to Thornton Wilder</span><span>’</span><span>s </span><span>“</span><span>Our Town</span><span>”</span><span>. When that class finally performed the Shakespeare play, a school district supervisor showed up. The high-ranking district administrator came up afterwards and shook his hand. </span><span>“</span><span>Rafe</span><span>”</span><span>, she said, </span><span>“</span><span>I</span><span>’</span><span>ve never seen Shakespeare done better.</span><span>”</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: right; font-family: Times New Roman;"></p>

It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation, long-term goals cannot amount to very munch without the achievement of solid short-term goals.

                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">Morgan Rees has always been a good businessman. He used to own three petrol stations and was busy most of the time. When he was 65, the normal retirement age, he decided that he didn't want to stop, so he carried on working for another two years. Eventually, when he was nearly 68, his wife, Dolly, asked him to retire because she wanted to enjoy their old age together. Reluctantly, he handed over the business to his son.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">But he was unhappy. He didn't know what to do with himself. Although he read a lot of books and he went on holiday to interesting places with his wife, he was bored and began to get depressed because he hated being retired.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">Then one day he saw an advertisement in the newspaper and, without telling his wife, he bought a small crockery (<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">陶器</span>) factory. The next week he told his family. They were horrified and worried. They thought he was too old at 71 to start work again.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">He is now 76 and he has expanded the company considerably. He has increased the number of staff from 6 to 24 and he has found many new customers for the products. He has developed the export market and has improved profits by 200%. He has opened a new design office and employed three young designers. They have been all over the world to get new ideas, and one of them has gone to France this week to a major trade fair. Most importantly, he hasn't been bored since he bought the factory. </p><p></p>

Although it originated as a religious holiday, it has lost its religious connections in the United States. It is now celebrated largely as a children's day, and many American children look forward to it for days and weeks beforehand.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>The orange pumpkin is harvested at this time of year and is hollowed out, a funny face cut into it, and a candle placed inside as decorations in the window. City folks, nowadays, sometimes use paper pumpkins for decorations. Some years ago, the holiday was celebrated by dressing up in strange and frightening costumes and playing tricks on one's neighbors and friends, such as ringing door bells, throwing bits of corn on the window panes, and in other ways making minor disturbances. More recently, children come to the door to have friends and neighbors admire their costumes and guess who they are behind the false faces and receive treats of candy, fruit or cookies. They say, "Trick or Treat", meaning "I will play a trick on you if you do not give me a treat."</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; font-family: Times New Roman;">    This practice has even more recently developed into a significant international activity. Instead of or along with candy, the children collect money for UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund). This special collection of money by children for needy children throughout the world is known as "UNICEF Trick or Treat". Begun only recently, it results in several million dollars each year contributed to UNICEF. The collection box is orange, reminiscent of the pumpkin.                                       </p><p></p>

Many years ago, however, there were millions of rats in it. They attacked the cats and dogs. Sometimes a great number of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very large in size and they harmed many people.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">The Government ordered everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they didn't kill many. The Government promised to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats everyday. A Government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile. Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the Government office. The Government officer thought that people were stealing dad rats from the pile. He ordered his men to dig a deep hole and put the rats in it. Soon there were no more rats, and the Government didn't pay any more money. </p><p></p>

The coffee spoon ought to be on the saucer, the soup spoon ought to be on the plate under the bowl. When you are having soup, make the least noises and use the side of your spoon inside out this way, not the tip. And you mustn't pick up your soup bowls so as to drink away the last drops of your soup from the bottom of the bowl.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>Very often there is only one main course and salad, followed by your sweet. If you find the meal not enough, say "Oh, it's delicious!" and ask for some more of the chicken or steak or whatever you have just had. The hostess will be very glad that you appreciate her cooking and will give you an extra portion. But if you observe the Chinese way of being polite and say "No, thank you" when the hostess offers you more, you will most probably starve later, because Americans will never press food on you. Yet it is not polite to keep silent and not to talk with the person next to you. It would be considered good manners if you handle your silverware with care so that they don't make any noise. When coffee comes, drink it from your cup. The coffee spoon should rest on the saucer while you are drinking. And smoking, of course, is rarely seen at a dinner table. Well, when the meal is finished, the guests put their napkins on the table and stand up, the men again helping the ladies with their chairs.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">After the dinner, the guests usually stay for an hour or two, then they would say, "Well, I'm afraid I must be going now." The host and hostess would of course urge everyone to stay longer. "What, already? Won't you have another coffee?" The guests, for instance, would say, "I'd love to, but I have to be up early tomorrow morning. Thank you for a most enjoyable evening. Good-night."</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">And if you stay overnight or over the weekend, it will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">courteous</span><span> to send a thank-you note to the host or hostess the following day, very often with a small gift such as a box of chocolate or some flowers as a token of appreciation of their hospitality.           </span></p><p></p>

                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.  </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one<span>’</span>s own.  </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Then, in the country one can really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">get away from</span><span> the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one</span><span>’</span>s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.  </p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight<span>’</span>s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.  </p><p></p>

The conditions Dickens described continue almost unchanged today in many parts of the world. The only difference is that today employment of children is confined to small industries and family businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and particularly farms, rather than to large factories.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>  Girls suffer more from child labor practices than boys. Many of them are forced to start work when they are only ten years old. Although the work they are given to do is often light, it is often harmful to their health. Recently, children as young as six years were found to be working in Asian factories, and the children were working from eight to fourteen hours a day in overcrowded and unhealthy working conditions. Sometimes a whole family group is employed, with the payment going to a parent or older relative. The children not only receive nothing or very little for their long hours of work, but also they are prevented from attending schools. Therefore, when they become older they are unable to do any other kind of work. </span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>The solution to the problem of child labour is clearly better laws to protect young children, greater supervision of industry and heavier fines for those who break the laws. Only in this way can young boys and girls be allowed to enjoy the most valuable time of their lives-childhood.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: right; font-family: Times New Roman;">                                                                    </p><p></p>

What makes one person a genius, like the brilliant Albert Einstein, and another person a fool? Are people born intelligent or stupid, or is intelligence the result of where and how you live? These are very old questions and the answers to them are still not clear.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>We know, however, that just being born with a good mind is not enough. In some ways, the mind is like a leg or an arm muscle. It needs exercise. Mental (done with the mind) exercise is particularly important for young children. Many child psychologists think that parents should play with their children more often, and give them problems to think about. The children are then more likely to grow up bright and intelligent. If, on the other hand, children are left alone a great deal with nothing to do, they are more likely to become dull and unintelligent.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Parents should also be careful what they say to young children. According to some psychologists, if parents are always telling a child that he or she is a fool or an idiot, then the child is more likely to keep doing silly and foolish things. So it is probably better for parents to say very positive things to their children, such as "That was a very clever thing you did" or "You are such a smart child".                                                        </p><p></p>

Today, however, we needn't worry about feeling pain during the operation. The sick person falls into a kind of sleep, and when he awakes, the operation is finished. But these happy conditions are fairly new.

Soon after 1770, Josept Priestley discovered a gas which is now called "laughing gas". Laughing gas became known in America. Young men and women went to parties to try it. Most of them spent their time laughing, but one man at a party, Horace Wells, noticed that people didn't seem to feel pain when they were using this gas. He decided to make an experiment on himself. He asked a friend to help him.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">Wells took some of the gas, and his friend pulled out one of Well's teeth. Wells felt no pain at all.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">As he didn't know enough about laughing gas, he gave a man less gas than he should have. The man cried out with pain when his tooth was being pulled out.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">Wells tried again, but this time he gave too much of the gas, and the man died.

The same comment is made from generation to generation and it is always true. It has never been truer than it is today. The young are better educated.

Office hours, for instance, are nothing more than enforced slavery. Wouldn't people work best if they were given complete freedom and responsibility? And who said that all men in the world should wear grey clothes and short hair? Why have the older generation so often used violence to solve problems?

Today, the situation might be reversed. The old could learn a thing or two from their children. One of the biggest lessons they could learn is that enjoyment is not "sinful". Enjoyment is a principle one could apply to all aspects of life. It is surely not wrong to enjoy your work and enjoy your leisure. It is surely not wrong to live in the present rather than in the past or future.                </p><p></p>

Racing through daytime meals is part of the pace of life in this country.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Working time is considered precious.

If you don<span>’</span>t, waiters will hurry you.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">You also find drivers will be abrupt and that people will push past you.

This is because people value time highly, and they resent someone else “wasting”</span> it beyond a certain courtesy point.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">The view of time affects the importance we attach to patience. In the American system of values, patience is not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a high priority</span><span>. Many of us have what might be called “a short fuse.”</span><span> We begin to move restlessly about if we feel time is slipping away without some return </span><span>—</span> be this in terms of pleasure, work value, or rest. Those coming from lands where time is looked upon differently may find this matter of pace to be one of their most difficult adjustments in both business and daily life.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Many newcomers to the States will miss the opening courtesy of a business call, for example, they will <span>miss the ritual socializing that goes with a welcoming cup of tea or coffee that may be traditional in their own country. They may miss leisurely business chats in a café</span><span> or coffeehouse. Normally, Americans do not assess their visitors in such relaxed surroundings over prolonged small talks. We seek out evidence of past performance rather than evaluate a business colleague through social courtesies. Since we generally assess and probe professionally rather than socially, we start talking business very quickly. </span></p><p></p>

                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">In 1985, the Coca-cola company made the decision to change the formula of its leading soft drink. The change was based on the findings of many market studies. These studies had shown that the general response to the new product was good. However, the change of the traditional Coca-cola by New Coke was rejected by the majority of drinkers. In fact, the company had to step back and restart production of the old formula of Coca-cola.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">The most important reason why New Coke was rejected was the emotional relationship that existed between drinkers and the old soft drink formula. Drinking Coca-cola had become a tradition for many people over its 99 years of existence. The change made by the company was not only in Coke<span>’</span><span>s formula but also in the traditional values and memories that it represented to the drinkers. </span><span>“</span><span>We had taken away more than the product Coca-cola. We had taken away a little part of them and their past.</span><span>”</span><span> The drinkers rejected this </span><span>“</span><span>improvement</span><span>”</span><span>, because </span><span>“</span><span>they believed that Coke stood for traditional valu</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">e</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">...</span><span>so they felt betrayed when the product changed completely overnight</span><span>”</span>.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Although a lot of research was done by Coca-cola company, it didn<span>’</span><span>t show the depth of drinkers</span><span>’</span><span>emotion for the product. The studies took many forms, but none of the tests was able to measure the degree of personal and emotional reactions caused by the disappearance of the old, traditional Coca-cola. The weakness of the research was that it was mainly quantitative in form. The result was only numbers that could not show the deep meaning the product had for many people. A more extensive study focusing on the qualitative aspects of the change would perhaps have been able to demonstrate the close relationship existing between drinkers and product.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: right; font-family: Times New Roman;"></p>

                <p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">How men first learnt to invent words is unknown; in other words, the origin of language is a mystery. All we really know is that men, unlike animals, somehow invented certain sounds to express thought and feelings, actions and things, so that they could communicate with each other; and that later they agreed upon certain signs, called letters, which could be combined to present those sounds, and which could be written down. Those sounds, whether spoken or written in letters, we call words.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">The power of words, then, lies in their associations <span>–</span> the things they bring up before our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience; and the longer we live, the more certain words recall to us the glad and sad events of our past; and the more we read and learn, the more the number of words that mean something increases.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;">Great writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which appeal powerfully to our minds and emotions. This charming and telling use of words is what we call literary style. Above all, the real poet is a master of words. He can convey his meaning in words which sing like music and which by their position and association can move men to tears. We should therefore learn to choose our words carefully and use them accurately, or they will make our speech silly and vulgar.  </p><p></p>

Their expectations of marriage are essentially utopian and therefore incapable of fulfillment. They want too much, and disappointments are often bound to follow.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>Shall we, then, join the chorus of </span><span>“</span><span>Miseries</span><span>”</span><span>over early marriage? One cannot generalize: all early marriages are not bad any more than all later ones are good. Satisfactory marriages are determined not by time, but by the emotional maturity of the partners. Therefore, each case must be judged on its own merits. If the early marriage is not an escape, if it is entered into with relatively few illusions or false expectations, and if it is economically feasible, why not? Good marriages can be made from sixteen to sixty, and so are bad ones.</span></p><p></p>

Thus work for women was not only approved but also was regarded as a civic duty. “清教徒认为懒惰是一种罪，生活在一个贫困的国家里，每个人都应该为经济发展尽一份力。因此，（他们）不仅仅支持女性工作，还认为这是一种公民责任。”可见，清教徒痛恨懒惰，崇尚勤劳自立。因此选B，“勤奋的”。A，“未受教育的”，C，“慷慨的”，D，“富有的”，都不符合文意。

To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. </span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of diversion, and brought news of the outside world. The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. </span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: if you didn</span><span>’</span><span>t take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation. Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. "I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner </span><span>–</span><span> amazing." Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly. </span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>The casual friendliness of many Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition. As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to "translate" cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example, when an American uses the word "friend", the cultural implications of the word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor</span><span>’</span><span>s language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many Americans value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers. </span><span>		</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: right; font-family: Times New Roman;"></p>

His parents hadn't enough money to send him to school. He had to help them to do something in the fields. But he didn't like to live in the poor place. When he was sixteen, he got to the town and found work in a factory. Three years later he became tall and strong. So he was sent to Africa as a soldier. He stayed there for five years and got some money. Then he came back to England and bought a shop in a small town. No people in the town went to Africa except him. And he hoped they thought he was a famous man and that they could respect him. The children often asked him to tell them some stories and his life in Africa.</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">One day a few children asked him to tell them something about the animals in Africa. He told them how he fought with the tigers and elephants. His stories surprised them all and some policemen and workers went to listen to him. It made him happier. Just a man who taught geography in a middle school passed there. He stopped to listen to him for a while and then said, "Could you please tell us a rare animal, sir?"</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">"Certainly," said Mr. Turner. "One day I met a rhinoceros<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">（</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">犀牛</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">）</span><span> by a river…</span>"</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">"Please wait a minute, sir," said the man. "There aren't any rhinoceros in Africa at all!"</p><p style="margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-indent: 20px; font-family: Times New Roman;">"It's rare just because there aren't any!" </p><p></p>
